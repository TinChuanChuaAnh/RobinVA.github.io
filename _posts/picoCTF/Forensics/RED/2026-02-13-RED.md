## Initial steps

We are provided a `.png` file. The first thing that I try to do is to use `exiftool` to check if the metadata has any useful information.

*Crimson heart, vibrant and bold,*

*Hearts flutter at your sight.*

*Evenings glow softly red,*

*Cherries burst with sweet life.*

*Kisses linger with your warmth.*

*Love deep as merlot.*

*Scarlet leaves falling softly,*

*Bold in every stroke.*

This is the poem that we got in the metadata. Take a closer look at each line's first letter. It gives you an important sign: `CHECKLSB`.

Basically, this is a steganography challenge, which requires us to check the LSB (Least Significant Bit) for the flag.

## Vulnerability analysis
### Potential vulnerabilities
* Steganography (LSB)

## Solution paths

When it comes to `.png` or `.bmp`, `zsteg` is more favourable than `steghide`. I do `zsteg` and the result is a Base64 code:

![zsteg](/assets/img/picoCTF/Forensics/RED/zsteg.png)

The text that I highlighted contains duplications of a Base64 code, so you do not have to copy the whole thing. The code is `cGljb0NURntyM2RfMXNfdGgzX3VsdDFtNHQzX2N1cjNfZjByXzU0ZG4zNTVffQ==`. Now we just need decode it.

You can also use CyberChef to decode.

## Flag
`picoCTF{r3d_1s_th3_ult1m4t3_cur3_f0r_54dn355_}`

## Commands/Tools used

> | Commands/Tools | Purpose(s) |
> |----------------|------------|
> |  `exiftool`    | Read `metadata`
> | `zsteg`        | Quick scan an image for text or raw data (zip, elf)

## What did we learn?

* We learned how LSB steganography works.
* Run `exiftool` to see `metadata` and `zsteg` for quick hidden information extraction.
